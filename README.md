# freakwan_mobile

That's a work-in progress, any recommendations, helps and bug fixes are very welcome!

## Disclaimer
I am not a very experienced developer, that's my first public and more significant project.
You'll be for sure better than me with Flutter and Dart (and of course git) so please be patient with me.

## Introduction
That's an attempt to create a multi-platform app (Android and iOS) to dialogate through [Freakwan](https://github.com/antirez/freakwan) nodes.
The idea is to be able to send, receive messages and edit device configuration through the app.

The app is based on [flutter_blue_plus](https://github.com/chipweinberger/flutter_blue_plus?tab=License-1-ov-file#readme) for BLE communication and the main device page is inspired from their example app (I didn't know where to start as I started learning Dart exactly for this project).

More details coming soon!
